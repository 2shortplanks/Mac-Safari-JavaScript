  use Mac::Safari::JavaScript qw(safari_js);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Error class for errors originating from Mac::Safari::JavaScript.

=head2 Constructors

=over

=item new(%params)

Creates a new instance of the object.  Expects the read only attributes (described below)
as parameters.  You shouldn't have to ever call this - these objects should be constructed
by Mac::Safari::JavaScript

=back

=head2 Accessors

The following read only accessors are avalible

=over

=item error

The original error object, if the object can be transported
over JSON (i.e. it does not contain undefined).

If the object cannot be transported, it is ommited.

=item name

The type of the error.  This can be one of the following:

=over 8

=item CustomError

=item EvalError

=item RangeError

=item ReferenceError

=item SyntaxError

=item TypeError

=item URIError

=back

The name C<CustomError> will be used for any error thrown with the C<throw> keyword
by you in your code.  Other error codes are assigned by Safari based on the type of
exception that occurs.

=item message

The string describing the error.

This value will not be set if you throw

=item line

The line number the error occured on.

This is only set for browser raised errors
or if you throw an exception object.  Throwing a string will not 

=item expressionBeginOffset

The index of the first character of your source code that threw
the exception object.

This will only be set if you manually throw an exception object
(and only an object, not a string.)

=item expressionEndOffset

The index of the last character of your source code that threw
the exception object.

This will only be set if you manually throw an exception object
(and only an object, not a string.)

=item sourceId

The unique identifier for the originating source of the error.

(The odd case for this accessor matches the odd case that Safari itself uses)

=back

=head2 Methods

=over

=item to_string

The stringiftication of this error.

This method is automatically called if you use this object in a string context.
